# Secret Santa Organizer

[**Try the app !**](https://secretsanta-yay.web.app/)

In my React practice I thought of a quick app to easily organize Secret Santas and pair a giver to a receiver randomly.

The process is pretty simple:
- Fill in the list of your participants, one person per line
- Click on randomize and get your results!

You can click multiple times if you want another random attribution.

**I wish you all a Merry Christmas!**
